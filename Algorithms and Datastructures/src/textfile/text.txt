A Set contains no duplicate elements. That is one of the major reasons to use a set. There are 3 commonly used implementations of Set: HashSet, TreeSet and LinkedHashSet. When and which to use is an important question. In brief, if you need a fast set, you should use HashSet; if you need a sorted set, then TreeSet should be used; if you need a set that can be store the insertion order, LinkedHashSet should be used.hello testhello testhello test
